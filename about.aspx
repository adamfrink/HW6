        Hey!

I’m Red Forman.  You may remember me from the hit TV series That 70’s Show.  After That 70’s Show was canceled due to Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) leaving to replace Charlie Scheen in Two and A Half Man and Jackie (Mila Kunas) leaving to film the motion picture Forgetting Sara Marshal, her role in which really made the movie, I’ve had a lot of free time on my hands.  To occupy myself I’ve been spending time driving my corvette and learning how cook.  Here are a few of my favorite subsistence recipes. Enjoy!
